//Nour's father used to read her the story in a sing-song voice; it was something she requested almost every night until she was in middle school.

NOUR: *Singing* Puff the magic dragon, lived by the sea...

NOUR: Baba used to sing that to me almost every night. I'd never stop asking for it...

NICK: I've never heard that song before! What's it about?

NOUR: *Explains puff the magic dragon lore* 

NOUR: Almost makes me wish I could ask my dad to sing it to me again. I used to feel so safe whenever he did...

NOUR: Weird how time flies, isn't it.
