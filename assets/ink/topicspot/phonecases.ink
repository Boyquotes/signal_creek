== phonecases ==

    It's a variety of rainbow-colored phone cases. Many have cute little animals on them covered in glitter. 
    
    Nick seems completely enamoured by them.

    NICK: "IS THAT... A FROG?"
    
    He picks the frog phone case up and smiles, admiring the cute design.
    
    He quickly takes out his phone, takes off the current case and tries to slip his phone into the new one.

    Nick grips the phonecase tighter. Protectively.

    Nick puts the case back and steps away from the case display.
