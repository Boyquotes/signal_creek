    FATHER FUJI: "I take it that the earthly Emperor Evercrisp tasked you with finding me?"
    
    NOUR: "Yes, you're right. We're looking for all the missing membersâ€” including your Prince."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "Ah... Yes. The Prince. How noble his core is, from stem to seed."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "But unfortunately, he has strayed and fallen far from the tree." 
    
    MS. SUWAN: "Care to explain more about this Prince of yours?"
    
    FATHER FUJI: "Since the invasion, our Prince has lost much self-esteem."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "Sent by his father, the Emperor, to Earth was he."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "No fault by him or his fights, but for his safety."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "Yet the young Prince saw it as failing his Daddy."

    FATHER FUJI: "Forced from space to Earth on a hyper-speed ride,"
    
    FATHER FUJI: "The prince hid in shame, with wounded pride."
    
    FATHER FUJI: "Called by his people, for help, they cried,"
    
    FATHER FUJI: "But the Prince fell silent as his confidence died."

    NOUR: "What's that?"
    
    FATHER FUJI: "A piece of information a Dream Walker ought to know."

            NICK: Nick opens his mouth to say something, but then shuts it immediately. 
            
            NOUR: "Did you want to say something, Nick?"
            
            NICK: Nick shrugs, but doesn't shake his head 'no'.
            
            MS. SUWAN: Ms. Suwan watches him closely.
            
            MS. SUWAN: "Maybe we should hear this out to the end."
    
    - Nick looks the other way, but walks closer to Father Fuji.
    
    FATHER FUJI: "[insert epic lore drop here]"
    
    Nick's eyes widen in awe. His eyes meet Ms. Suwan, and then his expression turns sour again. 
    
    FATHER FUJI: "May the Mother Tree guide thee..."
