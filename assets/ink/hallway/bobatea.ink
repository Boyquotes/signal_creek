    The vending machine is full of coffee, sparkling water, and diet sodas. The last row in the vending machine is a row of Specialty Drinksâ€”japanese sodas and canned boba.

    MS. SUWAN: "I don't recognize any of these brands. I find that disturbing."
    
    NICK: "These are all gross except for the boba!"
    
    NOUR: "Wouldn't you rather get fresh boba from an actual shop?"
    
    NICK: "Mmm... well..."

            NOUR: "Are you sure?"
            
            NICK: "Yeah. If I accept something from someone, I'd wanna repay them."

    NOUR: <i>We've already looked at all the drinks.</i>

    NOUR: <i>...Wait a minute. What's up with that boba can at the back?</i>
    
    MS. SUWAN: "I think there's something... <i>wriggling</i> inside that can?"
    
    &PORTRAIT_nour_nourrealization

    NOUR: "It looks kind of round... like an apple?!"
    
    NOUR: "We should buy the boba to free it. Do you want the boba, Nick?"
    
    NOUR: "I'm sure it'll taste real, um, apple-y. That's not too bad, right?"

    Nick shrugs. After a moment, Ms. Suwan clears her throat.
        
    MS. SUWAN: "It's been quite an eventful day so far. Perhaps a drink is warranted."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "It'd be a waste to get rid of the boba for the sake of an apple."
    
    Nick shakes his head 'no'.
    
        * ["We could all pitch in."]
        
        * ["Should we try to break it open?"]
            NOUR: "It could be time for a little B&E on this machine. What do you say?"
            
            NOUR: "It would be free."
            
            MS. SUWAN: "Let's be reasonable, please. We could simply all pitch in and pay."
            
            Nick smiles a little but quickly smothers it with a scowl.
        
    - NOUR: "Would you be more comfortable if we all split the price of the drink?"
    
    NICK: "...50 cents each?"
        
    MS. SUWAN: "Exactly."
    
    Nick sighs and mumbles.
    
    NICK: "...You have some too. Make it fair."
    
    NOUR: "We will."
    
    SFX COINS INTO VENDING MACHINE
    
    Nick fishes out two quarters from his pocket and inserts it into the vending machine.
    
    SFX CAN DISPENSED FROM MACHINE
    
    More quarters enter the vending machine. Soon, a can of boba rolls out.
    
    NOUR: "Here it is."
    
        * ["I'll crack it open."]
        
        * ["Ms. Suwan, could you open this?"]
            NOUR: "I trust you the most."
            
            MS. SUWAN: "Very well."
        
        * ["Do you wanna open this, Nick?"]
            NOUR: "You know more about all of this than the two of us."
            
            MS. SUWAN: "Agreed."
            
            Nick shrugs again and takes the can.
    
    - The can is opened, and an apple squeezes out!

    Ms. Suwan nods, and Nick drinks the canned boba. 
    
    NOUR: "How's that tasting, Nick?"
    
    &PORTRAIT_nick_nickbigsmile
