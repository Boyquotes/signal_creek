    NOUR: "...Uhh. Because."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "Because...?"
    
    NOUR: "Women."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "What."
    
    NOUR: "...Beautiful women. I will explain no further."

    MS. SUWAN: "Aha. I see."
    
    &PORTRAIT_mssuwan_mssuwanpondering
    
    MS. SUWAN: "Femininity is so strange when it's commodified and sold to us in this... particular form."
    
    &PORTRAIT_nour_nourpondering
    
    NOUR: "I agree. I used to think it's all part of this weird, lace-covered box society is trying to push women into."
    
    NOUR: "But I realized it can make a lot of people feel really powerful, which shouldn't be forgotten, y'know?"

    NOUR: "... Not me, though. I was pushed into being feminine a little <i>too</i> much to enjoy it."

    MS. SUWAN: "All very well and fair."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "I leaned into femininity very strongly when I was younger..."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "To put it plainly, it was the safest way for me to exist as a woman."
    
    MS. SUWAN: "At least, that's how I felt at the time."
    
    &PORTRAIT_nick_nicknervous
    
    NICK: "I don't know much about being feminine, but it always felt weird to walk by."
    
    NICK: "Kinda makes me uncomfortable even now."

    MS. SUWAN: "I think that's the normal experience for everyone regardless of you are."
